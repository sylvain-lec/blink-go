# Blink

Blink is a simple cross-platform notification app written in Go. It periodically sends desktop notifications to help you remember to blink, in order to help with dry eyes issues.
The idea came from reading this paper on the topic: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40467388/

## Features

- Sends desktop notifications at a configurable interval (every 15 seconds by default, change with the `-interval` flag)
- Works on macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Linux, and Windows
- Lightweight and easy to use
